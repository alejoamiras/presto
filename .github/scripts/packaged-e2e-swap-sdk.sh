# linker the playground resolves the SDK through its OWN node_modules
# (packages/playground/node_modules/@alejoamiras/presto -> ../../../sdk — there is no hoisted root
# copy); replace that symlink IN PLACE with the EXTRACTED packed tarball, so the playground resolves the
# packed code with no bun re-resolution. The tarball ships no node_modules, so link the workspace SDK's own
# node_modules into it — the packed code resolves its deps (@aztec/*, ...) through the exact pinned graph
# the workspace SDK uses (one graph). A failure here aborts the leg — never silently fall back to the
