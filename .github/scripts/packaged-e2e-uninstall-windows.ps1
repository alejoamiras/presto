# Full Windows uninstall proof: install the real NSIS setup, let the PRODUCT arm the state under test, run
# the real uninstaller silently, then assert clean removal AND documented retention.
#
# Extracted to a script (repo convention, cf. packaged-e2e-*.sh / updater-smoke-windows.ps1) so the SAME code
# runs in two places: the release draft-gate leg in `_e2e-packaged.yml`, and a branch-runnable probe against
# an already-published installer. The release pipeline refuses to run from a non-main ref (by design), so
# without that second entry point this logic could only ever be exercised after it was already merged and
# release-blocking.
#
# Arming is by the product, not by CI: `intent_enabled_now()` (autostart.rs) reads the Run-key ARTIFACT as the
# source of truth, so seeding that value is the moral equivalent of the user ticking "Start on Login". The
# launched app then derives the rest itself — it heals the value to its own exactly-quoted path and arms the
# crash-recovery task. Everything asserted GONE below is asserted PRESENT first: without that, every removal
# assertion would pass vacuously on a runner where the app was never installed.
