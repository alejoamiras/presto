; A stand-in for the installed app exe, so the harness can prove NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL actually INVOKES
; `"$INSTDIR\Presto.exe" --prepare-uninstall` (codex: the harness previously only compiled the
; macro). It records invocation ONLY when the `--prepare-uninstall` argument is present — proving the
; argument, not merely that something ran. The real app is not built under Wine; this is a stub. NOT shipped.
