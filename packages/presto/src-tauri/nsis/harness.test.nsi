; Test harness for `hooks.nsi` — NOT shipped in any bundle. Built and run by the Windows leg of the
; `cert-trust` CI job (.github/workflows/presto.yml).
;
; The POSTUNINSTALL hook has a property no other test can reach: it must be correct in the FIRST
; release that ships it, because a release cannot fix its own uninstaller. Getting it wrong wipes the
; user's trust anchor on a routine upgrade. So the guard is exercised for real here — a genuine NSIS
; uninstaller, built around the ACTUAL hook macro (included verbatim, never re-implemented), run on
; Windows under each of the three command lines it must tell apart (one of them — /UPDATE — is
; dead code in 2.8.1 silent updates and pinned as defense-in-depth; see hooks.nsi header).
;
; Observing the decision without touching a real trust store: the harness watches the hook's OTHER
; side effect, `RMDir /r "$PROFILE\.presto\certs"`. CI seeds a marker file in that directory
; before each run; whether it survives is exactly the guard's verdict. The `certutil -delstore` in the
; same branch is a no-op on a runner that has no such CA installed.
;
; Mirrors the Tauri NSIS template's context: `Var UpdateMode`, parsed from `/UPDATE` in `un.onInit`.
