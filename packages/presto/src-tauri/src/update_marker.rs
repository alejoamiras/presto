//! The Windows update-window marker (plan D18/D21/D22; piece-2 plan §2-§4).
//!
//! Windows `install()` hands off to NSIS and calls `std::process::exit(0)`, so the updater's file
//! lock dies exactly when the danger starts: for a few seconds the installed exe is being
//! truncated and rewritten in place by the installer's `File` copy (silent updates never run the
//! old uninstaller in tauri-bundler 2.8.1 — measured; on INTERACTIVE plain upgrades it genuinely
//! is deleted by the old uninstaller first), and any instance that runs the autostart heal in
//! that window can act on a half-written or transient target. The marker is the cross-process do-not-disturb sign for that window:
//! while one is live, no process heals, no process rearms crash recovery, no process starts a new
//! update, and explicit autostart-ON is rejected (OFF always works).
//!
//! Removal (next launch of the installed candidate) requires ALL FOUR: matching transaction nonce
//! (via the NSIS-written completion token), matching candidate version, matching canonical install
//! path (with the settled rename-tolerance clause), and crash recovery reconciled to CURRENT
//! intent. The in-payload deadline is a LIVENESS heuristic only — it recovers orphaned windows, it
//! is never trusted as a safety bound (an installer hung past it reopens the race; nothing here
//! pretends otherwise). File mtime is never consulted: it is forgeable by the same user who can
//! write the file.
//!
//! Everything that mutates recovery is expressed over INJECTED closures (the house
//! `enable_transaction` pattern) so the transaction tables test on every OS with counters — no
//! test ever touches the real scheduled task (piece-1 rule). Lock discipline is the CALLER's
//! (autostart.lock, held across load → decide → act; see plan §4) — this module is deliberately
//! lock-free so the tables stay pure.
