//! Cross-platform browser-trust-store management for the local CA anchor.
//!
//! `certs.rs` owns cert generation, paths, and the rustls config; this module owns ONLY the OS trust
//! mechanism. It never generates or reads a private key — every entry point takes an already-written
//! CA *cert* path that `certs.rs` derives.
//!
//! Backends:
//! - **macOS** ([`macos`]): the login Keychain via the absolute-path `security` CLI.
//! - **Linux** ([`linux`]): user-level NSS databases (`~/.pki/nssdb` + each Firefox profile) via
//!   `certutil` — NO root, honest per-store reporting when `certutil` is absent.
//! - **Windows** ([`windows`]): the CurrentUser `Root` store via the absolute-path `certutil.exe`;
//!   live-cert identity by serial (CN reserved for delete-all).
//!
//! Security posture (see plan §8): all shell-outs use `Command` + fixed argv (no shell string);
//! external binaries are resolved to safe absolute paths (a planted `certutil` in a writable PATH
//! dir is rejected). Name constraints on the anchor are defense-in-depth; the load-bearing control
//! is the keyless CA (it can sign nothing), so a trusted anchor in any store is harmless.
