//! Windows trust backend — the CurrentUser `Root` store via `certutil.exe` (absolute System32 path).
//!
//! Design (plan D3/D4, codex/audit): `certutil.exe` is a system binary (zero new Rust deps; the
//! established shell-out-by-absolute-path pattern, cf. `crash_recovery::schtasks_exe`). Everything is
//! exit-code-driven (locale-independent), never stdout-scraping.
//!
//! Live-cert IDENTITY (`install` verify, `status`, `is_ca_trusted`, `trust_new_anchor`, rotation's
//! delete-old) is matched by **serial** (`-store`/`-delstore Root <serial>`, parsed from the PEM via
//! `x509-parser`) — CN alone can't tell the CURRENT leaf's anchor from a stale rotation anchor that
//! shares the CN, so a CN check could report "trusted" while the live leaf chains to an absent root
//! (post-impl codex High, both hunts). **CN** (`-delstore Root "Presto Local CA"`) is
//! reserved for the ONE place we want "match all of ours": remove/uninstall, which deletes the live
//! anchor plus every rotation leftover. The serial paths are exercised by the manual release runbook.
//!
//! Consent: `certutil -user -addstore Root` raises the Windows root-CA trust dialog (that IS the
//! user's consent), so the CI integration test seeds non-interactively via PowerShell
//! `Import-Certificate` and exercises verify/remove instead (P4 spike I3; see `tests/trust_windows.rs`).
