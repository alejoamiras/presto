//! B5: `--prepare-uninstall` — the ownership-checked teardown the NSIS uninstaller (and the
//! manual/scripted wrappers on other OSes) run BEFORE the app is deleted, while the exe is still present.
//!
//! The hazard this guards against is a SECOND install — a copied instance (#429) — that shares this
//! user's `~/.presto` state. Uninstalling THIS copy must not strip the OTHER copy's autostart
//! entry, kill its crash-recovery, or delete the CA trust + certs it still relies on.
//!
//! The stored autostart entry is the ownership oracle, read STRICTLY (codex): destructive removal of
//! SHARED state (trust/certs) has a higher proof burden than the arm path, so only a healthy entry that
//! resolves to THIS binary ([`Ownership::ConfirmedOurs`]) — or the total absence of any entry
//! ([`Ownership::NoEntry`]) — permits it. A healthy entry pointing elsewhere, a broken one (which may be
//! another copy's entry on a removable volume), or an unreadable one is [`Ownership::ForeignOrUncertain`]:
//! we LEAVE everything shared and report why. If we cannot even resolve our OWN identity we fail closed the
//! same way — never delete shared state on a guess.
//!
//! Documented residual (codex): a second install that never armed autostart is invisible to this oracle, so
//! an `Absent`-entry uninstall still removes the shared CA trust that copy relied on. A per-install registry
//! would be the complete fix; until then such a copy must re-enable HTTPS.
//!
//! Every primitive is idempotent, so the NSIS `POSTUNINSTALL` belt re-running after this (or a retried
//! uninstall) is safe.
