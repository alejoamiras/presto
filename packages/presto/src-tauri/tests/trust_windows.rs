//! Windows trust integration (headless-safe subset). `#[ignore]`d; CI runs it with `--ignored`.
//!
//! P4 spike I3 outcome: adding a cert to `CurrentUser\Root` — via `certutil -addstore Root` OR the
//! .NET `X509Store.Add` — raises the Windows root-CA "Security Warning" dialog and cannot be done
//! silently (Windows design; the dialog IS the user's consent, which is correct for a real user but
//! un-answerable in a headless runner, so it hangs). So, exactly like the macOS leg, CI exercises only
//! the headless-SAFE read paths (`is_ca_trusted`/`trust_status` → `certutil -store`, which do NOT
//! prompt); the real add/remove flow (with its consent dialog) is covered by the manual release
//! runbook, NOT here. Do NOT read a green here as "the production Root add/remove is CI-covered".
