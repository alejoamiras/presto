//! macOS trust integration (headless-safe subset). `#[ignore]`d; CI runs it with `--ignored`.
//!
//! Audit R5 / H-1: `security add-trusted-cert` records trust in the user trust-settings *domain*,
//! which requires interactive authorization — so the FULL install flow cannot run non-interactively
//! on a headless runner (it would hang or return `errSecAuthorizationDenied`). This test therefore
//! exercises only the headless-SAFE paths: cert generation, and the status/verify query
//! (`security verify-cert`), confirming `crate::trust`'s macOS backend runs end-to-end without a
//! prompt. The real install/trust flow is covered by the manual pre-release runbook (spike I7), not
//! by CI — do NOT read a green here as "the production login-keychain trust path is CI-covered."
