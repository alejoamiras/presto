# Sign a synthesized updater-smoke feed IN PLACE (F-004 Layer A).
#
# A C4+ N-1 build enforces the signed-manifest envelope, so the local smoke feed must carry a
# `manifest` + `manifest_sig` signed with the SAME updater key N-1 embeds (the prod key — the synthetic
# N-1 keeps the committed prod pubkey). This assembles the canonical envelope from the feed, signs it
# with the key in TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY[_PASSWORD], and splices the two fields back in. Shared by
# updater-smoke.sh (macOS) + updater-smoke-linux.sh so the envelope shape has ONE definition.
#
# Encoding contract (kept in lockstep with presto_core::update_manifest):
#   - manifest     = base64(envelope.json bytes)
#   - manifest_sig = the .sig file content VERBATIM (tauri writes it as base64(minisign doc))
#
# Usage: sign-smoke-feed.sh <feed.json> <repo-root>
