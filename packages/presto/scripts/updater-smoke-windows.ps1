  Release-time updater smoke test (Windows / NSIS) — release-blocking.

  Windows sibling of updater-smoke-linux.sh. Proves a user on N-1 auto-updates to
  the just-built+signed build (N) via a local feed impersonating the configured updater host,
  and relaunches reporting version N. Answers the open `v1Compatible` question on
  Windows: does the updater download the .nsis.zip, minisign-verify it, run the NSIS
  installer SILENTLY (currentUser, no UAC), and relaunch?

  Trust model (no signing key needed): we serve an ALREADY-signed N .nsis.zip; N-1
  (unmodified) verifies the .sig against its embedded pubkey. reqwest on Windows uses
  schannel, which reads the Windows cert store — so a local CA trusted in LocalMachine\Root
  is honored.

  Windows vs Linux swaps:
    CA trust : Import-Certificate -> LocalMachine\Root (vs update-ca-certificates). MUST be the
               MACHINE store, not per-user: adding a CA to the per-user Trusted Root pops a GUI
               confirmation that hangs a headless runner; the machine store is admin-authorized
               (runner is admin) so it adds silently. schannel validates against both.
    hosts    : %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    install  : <setup>.exe /S  (silent NSIS, %LOCALAPPDATA%)   (vs cp + chmod AppImage)
    AV       : scoped Add-MpPreference exclusion (unsigned exe) (no Linux analogue)
    feed     : same bun server, no sudo (Windows binds :443 as user)

  Usage:
    updater-smoke-windows.ps1 -NVersion 9.9.9 -NArtifactsDir <dir> -N1Installer <setup.exe> -RepoRoot <root>
    -NArtifactsDir : dir with N's *-setup.nsis.zip, .sig, and pre-signed smoke-latest.json
    -N1Installer   : path to N-1's *-setup.exe
  UPDATER_SMOKE_MODE = positive (default) | negative (tamper the served zip, expect rejection)
                     | barrier  (piece-3 L8: hold the update open mid-NSIS via the sentinel baked
                       into N's NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL — a PRE-MUTATION barrier at the top of
                       Section Install (2.8.1 silent updates never run the old uninstaller);
                       assert the txn mid-flight (marker+handoff live, no token), the old exe
                       intact, and a second instance Q fully suppressed — no heal, no rearm, no
                       second download — then release and finish positive. Requires
                       UPDATER_SMOKE_BARRIER_PREFIX (run-unique prefix, baked at N build time).
                     | copy-initiator (arc-hunt r2 F2 regression: a COPY of the install drives the
                       update while the installed instance is closed and the copy REMAINS on disk.
                       The marker must record the INSTALLER's destination, not the copy's path —
                       pre-fix, N saw a path mismatch it could not prove absent and suppressed
                       reconciliation, stranding marker+handoff+token and skipping heal/rearm.
                       Also proves the F1 ownership gate: autostart is OFF here, so NO
                       crash-recovery task may exist afterwards.)
