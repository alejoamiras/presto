# Release-time updater smoke test (macOS).
#
# Proves a user on a resolver-selected lower same-key release (N-1) can auto-update
# to the just-built, just-signed build (N) AND the result relaunches successfully — the exact
# failure class that shipped in 1.0.1 (amfid hang after the in-place .app swap),
# which fresh-install smoke does not catch.
#
# How it works (no signing key needed):
#   - We serve the ALREADY prod-signed N artifact from a local HTTPS server
#     impersonating the configured updater host (hosts entry + a trusted local CA).
#   - N-1 (unmodified, as shipped) fetches its hardcoded endpoint, downloads N,
#     verifies the .sig against its embedded prod pubkey, swaps in place, and
#     restarts. We then poll /health until it reports version == N.
#
# Usage:
#   updater-smoke.sh <n-version> <platform-key> <n-artifacts-dir> <n1-dmg> <repo-root>
#     n-version       e.g. 1.0.3-rc.1   (the version being released)
#     platform-key    darwin-aarch64 | darwin-x86_64
#     n-artifacts-dir dir with N's *.app.tar.gz + *.app.tar.gz.sig
#     n1-dmg          path to the downloaded N-1 .dmg
#     repo-root       repo root (to locate the feed server script)
#
# n-artifacts-dir also contains smoke-latest.json, pre-signed by the isolated
# release signer. This smoke never receives or invokes the production key.
