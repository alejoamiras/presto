#
# The hook (src-tauri/nsis/hooks.nsi) decides whether to delete the user's local CA from the Windows
# trust store. It must skip that during an UPGRADE and do it on a real uninstall. A release cannot fix
# its own uninstaller, so getting it wrong ships permanently. The Windows leg of the `cert-trust` CI
# job runs exactly these cases on a real runner; this is the same thing under wine, in ~30s, so the
# hook can be iterated on locally instead of one 15-minute CI push at a time.
#
# It builds a throwaway image (wine + makensis), compiles harness.test.nsi around the REAL hook macro,
# and runs the resulting uninstaller under each command line, reporting how each was classified. The
# observable is the hook's own `RMDir` target: a seeded marker file survives iff the guard held.
