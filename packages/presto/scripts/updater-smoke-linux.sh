# Release-time updater smoke test (Linux / AppImage) — release-blocking.
#
# Linux sibling of updater-smoke.sh (macOS). Proves a user on a resolver-selected
# lower same-key (N-1) AppImage can auto-update to the just-built, just-signed build (N) AND the
# result relaunches reporting version N. It verifies Tauri's `v1Compatible`
# updater applies the shipped raw `.AppImage` (+ `.AppImage.sig`) in place and
# re-executes it. A red job blocks draft creation.
#
# How it works (no signing key needed — identical trust model to macOS):
#   - We serve the ALREADY prod-signed N `.AppImage` from a local HTTPS server
#     impersonating the configured updater host (hosts entry + a local CA trusted via
#     `update-ca-certificates`). The updater fetches over reqwest, whose Linux
#     TLS (native-tls→OpenSSL OR rustls→rustls-native-certs — NO bundled
#     webpki-roots in our tree) reads the SYSTEM trust store, so the local CA is
#     honored. N-1 (unmodified) downloads N, verifies the `.sig` against its
#     embedded prod minisign pubkey, swaps in place, and relaunches. We poll
#     /health until it reports version == N.
#
# Differences from macOS (updater-smoke.sh):
#   - CA trust   : update-ca-certificates (system store) vs keychain
#   - install    : cp + chmod +x a writable `.AppImage` vs hdiutil/ditto a .app
#   - execution  : AppImage runtime (needs FUSE — set up by the caller workflow)
#                  sets $APPIMAGE, which the Tauri Linux updater replaces in place
#   - no Gatekeeper/quarantine; GNU `sed -i` (no BSD '' arg)
#   - display    : the caller workflow provides Xvfb + dbus + a tray host
#
# Usage:
#   updater-smoke-linux.sh <n-version> <platform-key> <n-artifacts-dir> <n1-appimage> <repo-root>
#     n-version       e.g. 1.0.3-rc.1   (the version being released)
#     platform-key    linux-x86_64
#     n-artifacts-dir dir with N's *.AppImage + *.AppImage.sig
#     n1-appimage     path to the downloaded N-1 .AppImage
#     repo-root       repo root (to locate the feed server script)
#
# n-artifacts-dir also contains smoke-latest.json, pre-signed by the isolated
# release signer. This smoke never receives or invokes the production key.
