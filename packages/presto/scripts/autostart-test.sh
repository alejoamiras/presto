# L4 — hermetic autostart env proofs, in Docker (plan §6). Local-only, like test:nsis; NOT a CI job.
#
# What only a container can prove (the dev host can't — HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME coincide there):
#   1. D9: the owned autostart module watches XDG_CONFIG_HOME, not a hardcoded $HOME/.config — the
#      harness passes DIVERGENT dirs and the test asserts the decoy stays untouched.
#   2. C8: with home resolution UNAVAILABLE, every operation degrades to Err/Skip — the removed
#      auto-launch crate PANICKED here (`dirs::home_dir().unwrap()`). NOTE the trigger is narrower
#      than "HOME unset": `dirs` falls back to getpwuid, so this leg runs as `--user 12345:12345`
#      (a uid with NO passwd entry — the k8s/random-uid case) with HOME/XDG scrubbed. The first
#      draft used a bare `env -u HOME` and the getpwuid fallback wrote a REAL .desktop into the
#      invoking user's profile — that is exactly why this leg exists and why it lives in Docker.
#
# The crate is compiled INSIDE the container (a host-built test binary would need the host's glibc).
# First run is slow (image ~2 GB of tauri build deps + a cold cargo build); later runs reuse the
# named volumes below and finish in seconds-to-a-minute.
