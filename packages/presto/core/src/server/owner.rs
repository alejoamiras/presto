/// reason.
///
/// What genuinely remains: an attacker who accepts our identification connection and tears it down
/// fast enough to win a race against the table lookup gets `Unknown`, and `Unknown` exits. It is a
/// race they must win on every probe rather than a state they can hold, and losing it means being
