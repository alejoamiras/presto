//! In-use leases for cached `bb` versions — the cross-request guard `FINDINGS.md` B2 deferred.
//!
//! ## What this replaces
//!
//! Cleanup used to decide "is anyone using this version?" from the version directory's mtime: an
//! entry touched within a five-minute window was presumed active. That is a heuristic with two
//! failures. It is too WEAK for a long proof — one queued behind the prove permit for longer than the
//! window loses its binary — and it is inherently racy, because cleanup reads the mtime and then
//! unlinks, so a proof starting between those two steps is evicted anyway.
//!
//! F-06 made that sharper rather than milder: the total-size cap can evict a `Mainnet` version, which
//! the per-tier count policy never could, so entries that were previously immortal became eligible
//! while in use.
//!
//! ## Why a predicate is not enough
//!
//! The first version of this module exposed `is_leased()` and had eviction call it before deleting.
//! That is the SAME check-then-act shape as the mtime window, just with a better predicate: the lock
//! is released between the check and the `remove_dir_all`, so a proof that acquires in that gap still
//! loses its binary. (Caught by a codex review of the first attempt.)
//!
//! So eviction does not ask a question — it takes a RESERVATION. [`begin_evict`] and [`acquire`]
//! contend for the same map entry under one mutex, and whichever arrives first excludes the other for
//! as long as its guard lives. A version cannot be acquired while it is being deleted, and cannot be
//! deleted while it is held.
//!
//! ## Scope: in-process, and what that does NOT cover
//!
//! Exactly one presto instance serves at a time — the port bind in `server::start` decides which,
//! and eviction only starts AFTER that bind succeeds (a losing instance exits without ever sweeping;
//! that ordering is load-bearing and noted at the call site). Cleanup is otherwise spawned from this
//! process's own prove path. So within the app, every evictor and every executor share this address
//! space and a `Mutex` is the whole synchronisation story.
//!
//! **It does not cover other processes, and one exists.** `scripts/download-bb.ts` defaults to the
//! same `~/.presto/versions` directory and both replaces live entries and applies its own
//! retention deletion, with no knowledge of this registry. A developer running `bun run bb:download`
//! while the app is proving can still delete a binary in use. (An earlier revision of this comment
//! claimed every party lived in this address space — that was simply false; found by a codex review.)
//! That tool now refuses to touch the cache while the presto is answering on its port, which
//! converts a silent race into a clear message; a genuine cross-process protocol is not built here
//! because the remaining exposure is a developer-tooling collision whose worst outcome is a failed
//! proof and a re-download.
//!
//! ## Refcounted, not a flag
//!
//! Concurrent proofs of the SAME version are ordinary — two requests from one dApp — so release has to
//! mean "the last holder finished", not "a holder finished". A bare set would let the first `Drop`
//! unprotect a version another proof is still executing.
