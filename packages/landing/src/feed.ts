// B6: the signed auto-update feed is the single source of truth for the live STABLE version — an explicit
// promote step (release-presto.yml) flips `latest.json` only after the release gates pass, so the feed
// never carries an unpromoted RC. The landing download button derives its version from the feed instead of
// scanning the GitHub releases API (which had no prerelease filter and could surface an RC as the download).
//
// SECURITY: the browser does NOT verify the feed's Ed25519 signature, so the payload shape is UNTRUSTED.
// Accept ONLY a strict stable-SemVer `version`, and splice it solely into the canonical GitHub release TAG
// path segment — never interpolate a feed field into a URL host. Asset download URLs still come from the
// GitHub API's own `browser_download_url` (GitHub-origin), never from the feed.

// Same-origin on the deployed site (presto-landing.alejo-amiras.workers.dev/releases/latest.json); 404s harmlessly in local
// dev → the caller falls back to the GitHub releases page.
