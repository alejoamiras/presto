# Presto Landing Page

Static landing page for the Presto project.

Presto detection is HTTPS-first and never treats its witness-free HTTP diagnostic as proving
availability. The page can explain how to enable **Encrypted Connection** or repair certificate
trust, but it never persists consent or enables plaintext proving. Deliberate, current-tab-only HTTP
fallback belongs to an integrating dApp such as the playground.
