/**
 * B4 packaged-E2E: the COMPOSED proof.
 *
 * A real browser, loading the PACKED SDK (this playground built against the tarball), drives the
 * INSTALLED desktop app to a native `bb` proof over HTTPS — with HTTP-downgrade and WASM-fallback
 * disabled. The CI harness (see `.github/workflows`) installs the app, runs
 * `Presto --generate-certs-only`, seeds the generated CA into the OS/browser trust store
 * out-of-band (Linux: user NSS via certutil; macOS: sudo System keychain), writes a config with
 * `https_enabled:true` + `auto_approve_localhost:true` (auto-approves the localhost page's Origin, so no
 * /prove auth popup is needed), and launches the app so it serves TLS on :59834.
 *
 * The DECISIVE witness of "native bb over HTTPS" (not a silent WASM/HTTP shortcut): a
 * `200 https://127.0.0.1:59834/prove` carrying an `x-prove-duration-ms` response header. The server
 * adds that header ONLY after a successful `bb::prove` (`core/src/server/prove.rs`), and a WASM
 * fallback or an HTTP path never issues that request at all — so its presence discriminates the
 * accelerated-over-HTTPS path from every fallback. We ALSO assert the deploy itself succeeds (a real
 * proof was returned + the tx mined) via the shared `deployAndAssert`.
 *
 * `?forceProofs=true` makes proving actually run even on a dev chain; `?httpsOnly=true` (see
 * `aztec.ts:initializeNode`) forces the prover to HTTPS-only with NO HTTP downgrade. We do NOT set
 * `ignoreHTTPSErrors` — the TLS handshake MUST succeed against the seeded trust, or the proof is not
 * a trust proof. Served from localhost, so Chrome 142+ Local Network Access exempts it.
 *
 * Usage: bun run --cwd packages/playground test:e2e:packaged
