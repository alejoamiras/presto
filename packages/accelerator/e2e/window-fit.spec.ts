/**
 * The three popups sized to their content rather than to a scrollable frame. Authorize and
 * update-prompt cannot scroll at all, so whatever does not fit is simply gone; renewal now carries
 * `body.scrollable` as a floor, but a consent dialog that opens with its buttons below the fold is
 * still a defect, so it is held to the same fit assertion. None of the three had layout coverage,
 * which is how renewal shipped with its buttons under the bottom edge.
 *
 * Sized to VIEWPORT_SIZES, not WINDOW_SIZES: the title bar's `WEBVIEW_CHROME_HEIGHT` is exactly what
 * hid those buttons, so a spec that grants the page the full window height cannot see the bug.
