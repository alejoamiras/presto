/**
 * Tripwire for the JEST_WORKER_ID contract the test preloads rely on: @aztec/foundation's logger
 * must keep its Jest branch — a truthy JEST_WORKER_ID takes a synchronous fd destination and
 * NEVER constructs the worker-thread transport (which crashes under bun 1.4.0 after happy-dom
 * replaces the global MessagePort — oven-sh/bun#40268). This is unversioned upstream behavior:
 * if a future @aztec bump renames or removes the branch, this test fails the bump PR instead of
 * the playground suite crashing at import time.
 *
 * Structural verification of the actual branch (not a bare variable-name grep): the
 * JEST_WORKER_ID conditional's consequent must reach pino.destination, and the transport
 * construction must live outside that consequent. Resolved from a declaring workspace via
 * Bun.resolveSync so the check survives the isolated linker's node_modules layout.
