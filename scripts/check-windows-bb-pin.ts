/**
 * F-008: report whether the LIVE @aztec/bb.js version has a REVIEWED Windows bb.exe pin.
 *
 * Run this AFTER `bun install` — it resolves the installed bb.js version (the SAME key the Windows
 * Prebuild/Build Smoke gate uses via resolveWindowsBbChecksum), never the argv/aztec.js version.
 *
 * Read-only: it NEVER downloads the asset or writes a pin. A pin is added by a human after review (see
 * WINDOWS_BB_CHECKSUMS in packages/presto/scripts/copy-bb.ts) — a twice-downloaded asset is not
 * independent evidence. This step is INFORMATIONAL; the enforcing fail-closed check is the Windows CI
 * gate (resolveWindowsBbChecksum throws without an accepted pin), and the only automated bump caller
 * (aztec-stable → main) runs that gate.
